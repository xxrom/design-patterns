## 4 Object Oriented Programming

- Encapsulation (we can create classes with data and methods, and we can restrict access to some methods using `Closure` / `Factory Function` / new class syntax with `private fields` ES2020)
- Abstraction (hide complex calculations in classes, so we can create based on it more complex systems)
- Inheritance (inherit methods from object to another object)
- Polymorphism (Car / super Car will have `run` method but different realization)
