Strategy: Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

The Strategy pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern enables the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it, promoting loose coupling and flexibility in choosing different algorithms at runtime.

PaymentStrategy defines a common interface for all concrete strategies.
PaymentContext uses this interface to execute a payment using the current payment strategy. This setup makes it easy to switch between different payment methods at runtime.

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's runtime from a family of algorithms. It encapsulates each algorithm in a separate class, with a common interface for all of them. This setup allows for switching between different algorithms (strategies) dynamically based on the context within the application.

It's especially useful when you have multiple ways of doing something, and you want to decide which method to use only at runtime. Let's delve deeper into the main benefits and use cases of the Strategy pattern.

## Main Pluses of the Strategy Pattern

1. Separation of Concerns: Each strategy is encapsulated in its own class, separating the logic of different algorithms from each other and from the context in which they are used. This makes each strategy easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

2. Switch Strategies Dynamically: The pattern allows the strategy to be switched at runtime depending on the situation. This flexibility is particularly useful for applications that need to adapt to different conditions or user preferences.

3. Ease of Scalability: Adding new strategies or modifying existing ones does not affect the context class or other strategies. This makes the application more scalable and easier to extend with new functionality.

4. Avoids Conditional Statements: Instead of using multiple conditional branches to switch between algorithms, the Strategy pattern uses composition to delegate the behavior to a strategy object. This results in cleaner, more maintainable code.

5. Promotes Open/Closed Principle: The system can introduce new strategies without changing the context or the client code. This adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, part of the SOLID principles for object-oriented design, which states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Use Cases and Benefits

- Flexible Algorithms for Different Contexts: When an application needs to perform a certain task that has multiple possible ways of execution (e.g., different sorting algorithms or varying route calculation strategies), the Strategy pattern allows for selecting the most appropriate method dynamically.
- Adapting to User Preferences or External Conditions: Applications that adjust behavior based on user settings, environmental conditions, or other external inputs can benefit from dynamically switching strategies.
- Testing and Mocking: The pattern facilitates testing by allowing mock strategies to be injected into the context during tests, providing a straightforward way to test the application's behavior under various scenarios.
