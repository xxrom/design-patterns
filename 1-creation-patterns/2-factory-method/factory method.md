The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses change the type of objects that will be created.
This pattern is useful when there is a need to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.

In this example, EmployeeFactory is used to create different types of employee objects.
By using the Factory Method, we encapsulate the instantiation logic and make the object creation process adaptable to the given context.
